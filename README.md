## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your computer
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Basic understanding of using a terminal/command line

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syedalamshah/Python-fromScratch.git
   cd Python-fromScratch
   ```

2. Run any Python file:
   ```bash
   python 01_basics/01_variables.py
   ```

## 📖 Course Structure

The repository is organized into progressive modules:

### 1️⃣ Basics (`01_basics/`)
Learn the fundamental building blocks of Python:
- `01_variables.py` - Variables and data types (int, float, string, boolean)
- `02_operators.py` - Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other operators
- `03_string_operations.py` - String manipulation and methods
- `04_input_output.py` - User input and output formatting

### 2️⃣ Control Flow (`02_control_flow/`)
Master program flow control:
- `01_conditionals.py` - if/elif/else statements
- `02_for_loops.py` - For loops, range(), enumerate(), list comprehension
- `03_while_loops.py` - While loops and loop control (break, continue)

### 3️⃣ Functions (`03_functions/`)
Write reusable code:
- `01_functions.py` - Function definition, parameters, return values, lambda functions
- `02_scope.py` - Variable scope, global/local variables, LEGB rule

### 4️⃣ Data Structures (`04_data_structures/`)
Work with collections of data:
- `01_lists.py` - List operations, methods, and comprehensions
- `02_tuples.py` - Immutable sequences and tuple unpacking
- `03_dictionaries.py` - Key-value pairs, dictionary methods, comprehensions
- `04_sets.py` - Unique collections, set operations (union, intersection, etc.)

### 5️⃣ File Handling (`05_file_handling/`)
Read from and write to files:
- `01_file_operations.py` - Reading, writing, and managing files

### 6️⃣ Error Handling (`06_error_handling/`)
Handle errors gracefully:
- `01_exceptions.py` - Try/except/finally, raising exceptions, custom exceptions

### 7️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (`07_oop/`)
Learn OOP concepts:
- `01_classes_objects.py` - Classes, objects, methods, properties
- `02_inheritance.py` - Inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes

### 8️⃣ Practice Exercises (`08_exercises/`)
Test your knowledge:
- `01_basics_exercises.py` - Exercises for beginners
- `02_advanced_exercises.py` - More challenging problems

## 💡 How to Use This Repository

### For Complete Beginners
1. Start with `01_basics/01_variables.py`
2. Read the comments and explanations in each file
3. Run the files to see output: `python filename.py`
4. Modify the code and experiment
5. Complete exercises in `08_exercises/`

### For Each Topic
1. **Read** - Go through the code and comments
2. **Run** - Execute the file to see results
